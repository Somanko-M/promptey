    question: "What is an AI website builder and how does it work?",
    answer:
      "An AI website builder uses machine learning to generate a fully structured website from your prompt, layout preferences, and content. It designs pages, suggests images, and creates SEO-optimized copyâ€”all without coding required.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I customize the design created by the AI?",
    answer:
      "Yes! After the AI generates your site, you can tweak layouts, colors, fonts, and replace images or text using a visual editorâ€”no code needed. You retain full design control.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is coding knowledge required to use an AI website builder?",
    answer:
      "Not at all. These tools are built for non-technical usersâ€”no coding or technical skills are necessary. Simply provide your business type and preferences, and the AI handles the rest.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does an AI website builder include SEO features?",
    answer:
      "Absolutelyâ€”most AI builders auto-generate sitemaps, meta tags, responsive layouts, and even keyword suggestions to improve search engine ranking by default.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I integrate ecommerce or forms with AI-built sites?",
    answer:
      "Yes, many AI website builders allow you to add ecommerce capabilities, contact forms, booking systems, and chatbots with simple integrationsâ€”no technical setup needed.",
  },
